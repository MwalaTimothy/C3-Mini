# C3-mini vital Environmental Sensors (CLOUDFREE!)
This repository contains files for an environmental sensor using the C3-mini, a successor of D1-Mini, which is a popular microcontroller board for Internet of Things (IoT) projects. The environmental sensor measures various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and air quality, and can be used in a wide range of applications, including;
- smart home systems
- weather monitoring
- environmental sensing in industrial settings.

## Getting Started
To get started with the C3-mini project you need a MODUAR SENSOR SELECTION Box www.carenuity.com

## Usage
Once the code is uploaded and the wiring is correct, you can power on the C3-mini and start receiving environmental data from the sensor. You can customize the code to suit your specific needs, such as adjusting the sensor readings interval, adding additional features, or integrating with other systems.
