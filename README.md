C3-Mini Environmental Monitoring
This repository contains the source code and documentation for C3-Mini, an environmental monitoring system built using environmental shields and sensors.

Features
Real-time monitoring of environmental data, including temperature, humidity, air quality, and light intensity.
Data logging and visualization for historical analysis.
Alarm notifications for threshold breaches.
Modular design for easy expansion with additional sensors or shields.
Dependencies
Arduino IDE (version 1.8.9 or later): https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
Libraries:
DHT: https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library
CCS811: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CCS811
TSL2561: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TSL2561
SSD1306: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306
RTClib: https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib
Hardware Setup
Connect the C3-Mini to your Arduino board using the appropriate pins for I2C communication.
Attach the environmental shields and sensors to the C3-Mini following the manufacturer's instructions.
Make sure all the required libraries are installed in your Arduino IDE.
Usage
Open the C3-Mini.ino sketch in Arduino IDE.
Update the configuration settings in the sketch, such as Wi-Fi credentials, sensor calibration, and threshold values.
Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
Open the Serial Monitor to view the real-time environmental data.
Optionally, connect an OLED display to the C3-Mini to display the data on the device itself.
Data can also be logged and visualized using third-party tools or services, such as InfluxDB and Grafana.
